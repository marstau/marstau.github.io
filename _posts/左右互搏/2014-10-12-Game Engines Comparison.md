To be honest, Epic’s monster behemoth doesn’t really need any introduction at all. Now almost an industry standard in its third incarnation, Unreal Engine 3’s domination of the full-engine middleware sector is hard to argue against.
Still, the main criticism levelled against it – usually by its competitors, we should say – is that the engine is geared towards first- (or third-) person shooters. Nevertheless, customers have managed to extend and rip apart the engine to power everything from Japanese-style RPGs to open-world action-racing games like The Wheelman.
One of the emerging usage groups is for MMO development. In order to give the engine a better standing against dedicated MMO solutions like HeroEngine and BigWorld, and emerging threats like CryENGINE, Epic has tasked its China office with the development of Atlas, its persistent world server technology and MMO creation and management toolset.
Another new feature is Unreal Lightmass, a new global illumination solver that can produce lightmaps with smooth bounced lighting without the need to use any third-party technology. Generation of the lightmaps can also be farmed out by the new Swarm distributed processing solution to use idle CPUs locally and across networks.
The new Unreal Master Control Program is a new service-orientated architecture based on the Gears of War 2 persistent stat tracking system. It allows developers to track online populations and even domain-specific data mining such as level-based heat maps to quickly identify chokepoints and problem areas in multiplayer maps.
Finally, Epic has enhanced asset management by introducing the new Content Browser, which allows users to tag assets and then find them easily with search filters, allowing users to locate, preview and manage assets regardless of whether they’re loaded or not.

## Gamebryo Lightspeed
Developer: Emergent Game Technologies
Platforms: Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PC
Browser support: No
Cost: Available on request
Published titles: Fallout 3 (Bethesda), Civilization Revolution (Firaxis), Warhammer Online (EA Mythic)
Titles in development: Unannounced titles from Square Enix, Disney, Tencent, Sidhe and Tose
Middleware integrations: Nvidia PhysX and APEX, Scaleform GFx, Wwise, Speedtree, Illuminate Labs, NaturalMotion, Lightsprint, Aristen, Umbra, xaitment, memoraze, Allegorithmic, RAD
Although the new name might fool you into thinking it a new entry in Emergent’s middleware line-up, the company is clear on one thing: Gamebryo Lightspeed is very much the future for the global firm.
Having succeeded on its previous aims – to bring enterprise-level engineering to game middleware and to simplify multi-core development with Floodgate – Emergent is now pushing firmly into designer territory. “It’s the first offering from Emergent that is focused not only on engineers but also the needs of game designers,” says CEO Geoffrey Selzer. “It’s an all-in-one system that offers rapid prototyping, rapid iteration, and real-time, on-target updates.”
As such, Lightspeed adds a data-driven framework to the existing Gamebryo tech base, enabling designers to iterate mechanics and ideas within hours rather than weeks. In fact, given that it features the entire Gamebryo feature set under the hood – the same feature set that’s powered genre-diverse games as big as Fallout 3 and Warhammer Online – it’s being placed as a solution that not only gets you rapidly prototyping, but can then follow with the development cycle all the way up to mastering up.
The new toolset includes an Entity Modelling Tool to control the new entity and behaviour system; a brand-new World Builder that ties into the entity system; an Asset Controller that automatically monitors for changes in assets, hotloading them into the tools and onto target platforms in real-time without recompliation; and a script integration system that allows you to use the scripting language of your choice.
Add to that the work it is doing in supporting small start-up developers – the number of small studios it hosted on its GDC stand was impressive – and Emergent’s market share is only set to grow.

## CryENGINE 3
Developer: Crytek
Platforms: Xbox 360, PS3, PC, ‘MMO and next-gen ready’
Browser support: No
Cost: Available on request
Published titles: Crysis (CryTek), Crysis Warhead (Crytek), Aion (NCsoft)
Titles in development: Not disclosed
Middleware integrations: Scaleform GFx, CRI, FMOD
Those expecting Crytek to mirror Epic in terms of version numbering might have been surprised to see CryENGINE hit version three so quickly, but maybe it’s important to be on an even playing field with your punchiest competitor.
The main addition to v3 is the long sought after console support – the formerly PC-only engine is now fully supported on Xbox 360 and PS3, with the developer at pains to point out that it’s worked the graphics, physics, AI, networking and sound subsystems to make them ready for the massively many-core architectures likely to find themselves in the next generation of consoles.
Of course, this is CryENGINE, so what you really care about is the visuals. Crytek has seen fit to add a huge number of high-end graphical features to the engine, including a real-time dynamic global illumination solution fully optimsed for current-generation machines. There’s also a new real-time soft particle system, which can be affected by object collisions, forces such as wind and gravity, and lighting and shadows; volumetric light beams; screen-space ambient occlusion support, a unique deferred shading solution and a high-level platform-agnostic shader scripting technology.
The ‘What You See is What You Play’ Sandbox editor – which now deploys live to target consoles, giving instant feedback to scene changes – has also had its functionality bolstered, with a new automatic vegetation placement ruleset that’ll plant your foliage based on slope, surface altitude and desired density. There’s also dedicated road and river builders, a specialised vehicle editor, a facial animation tool, plus automatic navmesh generation unified for inside and outside spaces coupled with the engine’s dynamic pathfinding system. And, as if that wasn’t enough, there’s a fully featured audio offering, AI and game scripting by Lua or the graphical Flow-Graph system, an integrated physics engine and a full suite of performance analysis tools.

## Unity 3D
Developer: Unity Technologies
Platforms: PC, Mac, iPhone, Wii
Browser support: Yes
Cost: $199 (Indie), $1499 (Pro), $399+ (iPhone), $15,000 (WiiWare, per title), $30,000 (Wii, per title)
Published titles: FusionFall (Cartoon Network), Zombieville USA (mikamobile)
Titles in development: Secret MMO by Funcom, other unannounced products
Middleware integrations: PhysX, Mono, more to come
We first covered Unity in these pages about a year ago, as it started to make more of an impact in the indie/low-end development market. For all its virtues, though, it was hampered by being Mac-only.
Unity 2.5, launched at GDC, finally brings the Unity toolset to Windows and all those developers unwilling to switch to Macs for the sake of a nice engine. The editor differs from many in being entirely visual-lead – assets can be imported into projects by a simple drag-and-drop (that actually opens the host application in the background to export with optimal settings) and scripts are linked visually.
The editor is also now completely scriptable, meaning that new workflows and interfaces can quickly be made up. Several members of the community have made new editors freely available, including a pathfinding module with automatic (and manual) nagivation mesh generation and behavioural tree editors.
The community is something that Unity Technologies considers a big selling point of the engine: the low entry point means that many hobbyist and indie developers are ardent supporters. As they rationalise it, when big triple-As like Funcom and EA embark on development, they’ve got a wide (and educated) support base and also a pool of ready-trained talent to recruit from. Parts of Cartoon Network’s MMO FusionFall were developed by community members, for example.
It’s also got arguably the best iPhone support, with the actual device acting as an input method to the editor to fine-tune accelerometer controls. According to the company, a new Unity-powered iPhone game is added to the App Store almost every day.
Other console support is currently limited to Wii, but support for Xbox 360 and PS3 is firmly within the company’s roadmap, as are the MMO functionality updates spun out from the success of FusionFall.

## BlitzTech
Developer: Blitz Games Studios
Platforms: PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, PC
Browser support: No
Cost: Available on request
Published titles: House of the Dead: Overkill (Headstrong), Power Up Forever (Blitz Arcade), Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore 2 (Blitz Games)
Titles in development: Dead to Rights Retribution (Volatile Games), Invincible Tiger (Blitz Arcade), many more TBA
Middleware integrations: FMOD, Kynapse, Bink
Given the Oliver brothers’ frequent comments about the horrors of middleware, it was quite a surprise to see Blitz move into the technology licensing arena. But all due credit to them – if you’ve got a platform- and genre-agnostic offering that’s been fine-tuned over the past 10 years, why not let other people use it?
Although the internal uses of the tech are diverse – from the next-gen Dead to Rights to almost all of Blitz Arcade’s digital-distribution titles – the company is keen to market BlitzTech to triple-A developers only. It’s built for large-scale development, with in-built asset management that supports remote working and in-built version control.
The focus is therefore very much on tools and the asset pipeline to support big teams, with the editor allowing designers and artists to work on multiple SKUs – including technologically disparate ones – through one interface. The editor can also be deployed on the target console to give immediate feedback and allow users to move objects, change properties and update assets in real-time.
The engine is also certainly leading in graphical aspects too, as anyone who’s seen the amazing-looking Dead to Rights in person will attest. One particular highlight is that it runs entirely on dynamic lights – there are no pre-baked lightmaps whatsoever – on both the Xbox 360 and PS3,
which gives better lighting and immediate feedback for artists. Of course, if you do want to do any complicated offline baking, the engine’s built-in distributed network processing system will help make it a much quicker process.
Finally, one of the real distinguishing features is BlitzTech’s support for true stereoscopic 3D on current-generation consoles. Blitz is firm in its belief that 3D is the future, but is happily licensing out that technology now, including compatibility for the numerous standards that currently exist.

## Infernal Engine
Developer: Terminal Reality
Platforms: Xbox 360, PS3, PC, Wii, PS2, PSP
Browser support: No
Cost: Available on request
Published titles: Ghostbusters (Terminal Reality), Mushroom Men: Spore Wars (Red Fly)
Titles in development: The Strike and The Hunt (Piranha Games), Cook or be Cooked (Red Fly), plus unannounced titles from Wideload and more
Middleware integrations: Scaleform GFx, FMOD, Wwise, Bink, Fonix, Quazal
If there was ever a good time for Terminal Reality to launch its own games engine, the run-up to the release of the hotly-anticipated Ghostbusters game would definitely be it.
Good-looking screenshots aside, the Infernal Engine is built from the developer’s 15 year history in the industry, during which time it’s shipped more than 30 titles. As such, much of the focus is on streamlining production. Take, for example, the integrated editor: not a major distinguishing feature on it’s own, but it enables collaborative level design, farms out lightmapping and other intensive processes to servers, has an integrated performance monitoring and memory tracking system, and even optimises the packaging of game assets to minimise disk seeks on physical media (a whole separate middleware area in its own right).
The areas the engine touches are far wider than just productivity, though: it has its own physics system called VELOCITY that can simulate thousands of objects at once, as well as dynamic destruction and cloth simulation. The developer has also recently added the dynamic collision avoidance AI used in Ghostbusters to cope with massively dynamic environments, and is close to rolling out ‘dramatic improvements’ in its animation system.
Audio is also catered for, with a data-driven engine with support for streaming on all platforms, real-time remote connection to tweak sound cues during playback, integrated positioning, spatialisation and Doppler shift for 3D audio.
The engine’s C++-like scripting language Dante offers all of the benefits of a compiled language – quick execution, small memory footprint – but, curiously, features immediate feedback of script changes without recompilation.
Given its wide platform support and future-proofed multi-threaded architecture, the Infernal Engine could easily be a big player in the market.

## Vision Engine 7.5
Developer: Trinigy
Platforms: PC (DX9 & 10), Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii
Browser support: No
Cost: Available upon request
Published titles: Desperados 2 (Atari), Emergency 3 & 4 (Take 2), Warlord (Neowiz)
Titles in development: Dungeon Hero (Firefly), Arcania – A Gothic Tale (JoWood), plus unannounced Ubisoft and Neowiz projects
Middleware integrations: Bullet physics, Digital Molecular Matter, FMOD Ex, Kynapse, morpheme, NetDog, OpenAL, PhysX, ProFX 2, Quazal Net-Z, Scaleform GFx, SpeedTree, xaitEngine
Trinigy’s Vision Engine continues to pick up pace in the international market, and is actually leading in some respects (it’s the first engine to integrate Pixelux’s Digital Molecular Matter, as used in LucasArts’ Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, for example).
Although it might not be a name with the same clout of Unreal, its strongly genre-agnostic structure is clearly finding more and more fans across the industry. Version 7.5 – released earlier this year – adds a complete DirectX 10 engine that makes ‘full use’ of the DX10 feature set, as well as an enhanced PhysX integration that allows visual editing of physical properties and joints. The engine’s event and trigger system have also been fully integrated into the editor, and Wii support has also been overhauled.
“The feedback we get from our 100-plus licensees is that Vision is simply the best overall package,” says Dag Frommhold, managing parter at Trinigy. “The engine is completely genre-agnostic and is flexible enough to adapt to almost any project’s needs, whether it’s a casual game or triple-A title.”
Much effort has also been placed into Vision Engine’s multi-platform capabilities, with extensive optimisations provided for each platform. Scenes and models can be examined live on the actual machine for instant on-target viewing, while console-specific features – such as SPU balancing on PS3 and direct GPU to memory export on Xbox 360 – ensure that performance is equal on comparable targets.
Finally, extensive documentation is available, including over 60 sample applications – ranging from concepts as simple as Hello World to efficient use of multi-threading. A number of sample scenes are also provided to demonstrate powerful features to artists, and video tutorials can also be downloaded from the Trinigy website.

## Bigworld Technology Suite
## Vicious Engine 2
Developer: Vicious Cycle Software 
Platforms: PC, Xbox 360, PS3 (VE2); PSP, PS2, Wii (VE)
Browser support: No
Cost: Available on request
Published titles: Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard (Vicious Cycle), Dead Head Fred (Vicious Cycle), Hilton serious game (Virtual Heroes)
Titles in development: Unannounced
Ambitious independent developer turned engine provider Vicious Cycle is more than aware that it can’t compete with Epic in the super high-end AAA stakes. The niche it’s looking to fill are the smaller developers who have to move quick in order to survive; not those that can take three years on a project.
Version one of the Vicious Engine – which is geared to lower-end platforms such as the PSP, PS2 and Wii – is still available, but what the company is really crowing about is the new version, Ve2, launched at GDC 2009. Teased for a number of years, the engine takes the Vicious Engine’s philosophy – of enabling teams to rapidly prototype and shorten the development process – and brings it kicking and screaming into the PS3 and Xbox 360 territory.
The engine provides a fully-rounded toolset, including navmesh-based pathfinding, an easy editor for creating re-usable hierarchical state machines, and contextual point-and-click scripting for those who don’t want to get their hands dirty with code.
Also, according to the developer, the engine will convert your game to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC ‘simultaneously at the push of a button’, which is quite the claim. It’s also got an in-built asset manager with a version control system to make sure that all assets are checked out when working on them and to ensure that assets remain frozen as milestones approach.
Ve2 also features a robust physics system that includes ragdolls, inverse kinematics, surface friction, hinge constraints and object buoyancy. A new lighting system also means that placement, colour and intensity of lights can be quickly prototyped in the editor without the need to bake lightmaps, but ambient occlusion maps can still be baked to improve real-time performance.

## Torque 3D
Developer: GarageGames
Platforms: PC, Mac, Xbox 360, Wii, iPhone, PS3, PSP
Browser support: Yes
Cost: PC/Mac/Web: $1,000 (indie, unlimited projects); $4k+ (studio licence, unlimited projects). iPhone: $500+ per seat. Console: undisclosed.
Published titles: Penny Arcade Adventures, Fallen Empire: Legions, Buccaneer, Dreamlords, Marble 
Blast Ultra
Titles in development: Unannounced titles from EA, Bioware, Ubisoft and more
Middleware integrations: FMOD, PhysX, ODE, Pixomatic, pureLIGHT
The latest generation of GarageGames’ Torque engine, the slightly anachronistically-named Torque 3D, is gearing up to take back some of the market share that the firm – admittedly one of the very first companies to dual-target the indie/hobbyist and professional markets – has lost to competitors of late.
With a proven tech backbone that’s already available on multiple consoles – with PSP and PS3 set to join the crowd later this year – the focus for Torque 3D is the toolset. “It’s been completely overhauled, and we’ve focused particularly on the content pipeline for ease-of-use and iteration,” says the company’s Brett Seyler.
As such, as well as a robust COLLADA import pipeline, all assets are updated live in-engine from external tools, allowing for zero-second asset iteration. The world editor has also been completely rewritten, offering advanced editors for materials, decals and, most interestingly, rivers and roads.
That doesn’t mean that high-end graphical effects have been overlooked, though. The lighting model has been upgraded to a hybrid lighting model which it calls ‘light pre-pass rendering’ that the firm says is ‘similar to CryEngine’s’, supporting advanced effects such as screen-space ambient occlusion and light rays, soft particles and advanced wetness and precipitation shaders.
Although high-end features are a focal point for Torque 3D, the company is still putting as much focus as ever on low-end hardware, specifically netbooks, citing good performance on Intel 950 chipsets. The mass-market penetration is also targeted with the engine’s new Web Publishing features, based on technology GarageGames developed for its InstantAction web portal, which offers native performance through browsers.
