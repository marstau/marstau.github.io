## xbuild[More](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/tools/xbuild/)
Mono’s implementation of msbuild and it allows projects that have an msbuild file to be compiled natively on Linux. xbuild has been part of the standard Mono distribution for some time now, but it is not 100% complete yet.

xbuild command is mostly the same as msbuild
eg:

```
xbuild ../../../Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/UnrealBuildTool_Mono.csproj /property:Configuration="Development" /verbosity:quiet /nologo |grep -i error
```
