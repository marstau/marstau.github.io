You’ll need to disable the NEON code at compile time when building for the simulator, as your application is compiled for x86 when targeting the simulator, and NEON code will cause build errors in this context. This means you always need to also write a generic C version of the algorithm, even if you only target the iPad, or you won’t be able to run your application in the simulator.
