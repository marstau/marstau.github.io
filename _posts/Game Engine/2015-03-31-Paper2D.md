#### Collision[More](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Support/Builds/ReleaseNotes/2015/4_7/index.html)
* In many cases it may make more sense to attach collision components (e.g., a box component) to a socket on the flipbook component rather than directly generating collision from source frames, especially if you want some collision regions to overlap while others block
* Character movement still relies on the collision capsule, in most cases you want to use a different collision channel for the flipbook than BlockAll to prevent the capsule from getting stuck on the flipbook (move/be blocked based on the capsule, and test for overlap or collision with projectiles based on the flipbook)
