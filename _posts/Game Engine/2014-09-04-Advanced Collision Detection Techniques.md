Since the advent of computer games, programmers have continually
devised(发明) ways to simulate the world more precisely. Pong, for
instance, featured a moving square (a ball) and two paddles(开关).
Players had to move the paddles to an appropriate position at an
appropriate time, thus rebounding the ball toward the opponent and away
from the player. The root of this basic operation is primitive(by
today’s standards) collision detection. Today’s games are much more
advanced than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*Pong*, and
most are based in 3D. Collision detection in 3D is many magnitudes more
difficult to implement than a simple 2D Pong game. The experience of
playing some of the early flight simulators illustrated how bad
collision detection can ruin a game. Flying through a mountain peak and
surviving isn’t very realistic. Even some recent games have exhibited
collision problems. Many game players have been disappointed by the
sight of their favorite heroes or heroines with parts of their bodies
inside rigid walls. Even worse, many players have had the experience of
being hit by a rocket or bullet that was “not even close” to them.
Because today’s players demand increasing levels of realism, we
developers will have to do some hard thinking in order to approximate
the real world in our game worlds as closely as possible.

This article will assume a basic understanding of the geometry and math
involved in collision detection. At the end of the article, I’ll provide
some references in case you feel a bit rusty in this area. I’ll also
assume that you’ve read Jeff Lander’s Graphic Content columns on

approach to collision detection by first looking at the whole picture
and then quickly inspecting the core routines. I’ll discuss collision
detection for two types of graphics engines:<span
style="background-color:#e53333;"> portal-based and BSP-based
engines</span>. Because the geometry in each engine is organized very
differently from the other, the techniques for world-object collision
detection are very different. The object-object collision detection, for
the most part, will be the same for both types of engines, depending
upon your current implementation. After we cover polygonal collision
detection, we’ll examine how to extend what we’ve learned to curved
objects.

**The Big Picture**

To create an optimal collision detection routine, we have to start
planning and creating its basic framework at the same time that we’re
developing a game’s graphics pipeline. Adding collision detection near
the end of a project is very difficult. Building a quick collision
detection hack near the end of a development cycle will probably ruin
the whole game because it’ll be impossible to make it efficient. In a
perfect game engine, collision detection should be precise, efficient,
and very fast. These requirements mean that collision detection has to
be tied closely to the scene geometry management pipeline. Brute force
methods won’t work — the amount of data that today’s 3D games handle per
frame can be mind-boggling(吃惊). Gone are the times when you could
check each polygon of an object against every other polygon in the
scene.

Let’s begin by taking a look at a basic game engine loop (Listing 1). A
quick scan of this code reveals our strategy for collision detection. We
assume that collision has not occurred and update the object’s position.
If we find that a collision has occurred, we move the object back and do
not allow it to pass the boundary (or destroy it or take some other
preventative(可预防的) measure). However, this assumption is too
simplistic because we don’t know if the object’s previous position is
still available. You’ll have to devise a scheme for what to do in this
case (otherwise, you’ll probably experience a crash or you’ll be stuck).
If you’re an avid game player, you’ve probably noticed that in some
games, the view starts to shake when you approach a wall and try to go
through it. What you’re experiencing is the effect of moving the player
back. Shaking is the result of a coarse time gradient (time slice).

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

But our method is flawed. We forgot to include the time in our equation.
Figure 1 shows that time is just too important to leave out. Even if an
object doesn’t collide at time t1 or t2, it may cross the boundary at
time t where t1 \< t \< t2. This is especially true when we have large
jumps between successive frames (such as when the user hit an
afterburner or something like that). We’ll have to find a good way to
deal with &nbspdiscrepancy as well.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

We could treat time as a fourth dimension and do all of our calculations
in 4D. These calculations can get very complex, however, so we’ll stay
away from them. We could also create a solid out of the space that the
original object occupies between time t1 and t2 and then test the
resulting solid against the wall (Figure 2).

<span style="background-color:#337fe5;">An easy approach</span> is to
create a convex hull around an object’s location at two different times.
This approach is very inefficient and will definitely slow down your
game. Instead of constructing a convex hull, we could construct a
bounding box around the solid. We’ll come back to this problem once we
get accustomed to several other techniques.

<span style="background-color:#337fe5;">Another approach</span>, which
is easier to implement but less accurate, is to subdivide the given time
interval in half and test for intersection at the midpoint. This
calculation can be done recursively for each resulting half, too. This
approach will be faster than the previous methods, but it’s not
guaranteed to catch all of the collisions.

Another hidden problem is the collide\_with\_other\_objects() routine,
which checks whether an object intersects any other object in the scene.
If we have a lot of objects in the scene, this routine can get very
costly. If we have to check each object against all other objects in the
scene, we’ll have to make roughly

![](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000330/bobic_eq_01.gif)

(N choose 2) comparisons. Thus, the number of comparisons that we’ll
need to perform is of order N2 (or O(N2)). But we can avoid performing
O(N2) pair-wise comparisons in one of several ways. For instance, we can
divide our world into objects that are stationary (collidees) and
objects that move (colliders) even with a v=0. For example, a rigid wall
in a room is a collidee and a tennis ball thrown at the wall is a
collider. We can build two spatial trees (one for each group) out of
these objects, and then check which objects really have a chance of
colliding. We can even restrict our environment further so that some
colliders won’t collide with each other — we don’t have to compute
collisions between two bullets, for example. This procedure will become
more clear as we move on, for now, let’s just say that it’s possible.
(Another method for reducing the number of pair-wise comparisons in a
scene is to build an octree. This is beyond the scope of this article,
but you can read more about octrees in<span
class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*Spatial Data Structures:
Quadtree, Octrees and Other Hierarchical Methods*, mentioned in the “For
Further Info” section at the end of this article.) Now lets take a look
at portal-based engines and see why they can be a pain in the neck when
it comes to collision detection.

 

**Portal Engines and Object-Object Collisions**

Portal-based engines divide a scene or world into smaller convex
polyhedral sections. Convex polyhedra are well-suited for the graphics
pipeline because they eliminate overdraw. Unfortunately, for the purpose
of collision detection, convex polyhedra present us with some
difficulties. In some tests that I performed recently, an average convex
polyhedral section in our engine had about 400 to 500 polygons. Of
course, this number varies with every engine because each engine builds
sections using different geometric techniques. Polygon counts will also
vary with each level and world.

Determining whether an object’s polygons penetrate the world polygons
can be computationally expensive. One of the most primitive ways of
doing collision detection is to approximate each object or a part of the
object with a sphere, and then check whether spheres intersect each
other. This method is widely used even today because it’s
computationally inexpensive. We merely check whether the distance
between the centers of two spheres is less than the sum of the two radii
(which indicates that a collision has occurred). Even better, if we
calculate whether the distance squared is less than the sum of the radii
squared, then we eliminate that nasty square root in our distance
calculation. However, while the calculations are simple, the results are
extremely imprecise (Figure 3).

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

But what if we use this imprecise method as simply a first step. We
represent a whole character as one big sphere, and then check whether
that sphere intersects with any other object in the scene. If we detect
a collision and would like to increase the precision, we can subdivide
the big sphere into a set of smaller spheres and check each one for
collision (Figure 4). We continue to subdivide and check until we are
satisfied with the approximation. This basic idea of hierarchy and
subdivision is what we’ll try to perfect to suit our needs.

Using spheres to approximate objects is computationally inexpensive, but
because most geometry in games is square, we should try to use
rectangular boxes to approximate objects. Developers have long used
bounding boxes and this recursive splitting to speed up various
ray-tracing routines. In practice, these methods have manifested as
octrees and axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Figure 5 shows an AABB
and an object inside it.

“Axis-aligned” refers to the fact that either the box is aligned with
the world axes or each face of the box is perpendicular to one
coordinate axis. This basic piece of information can cut down the number
of operations needed to transform such a box. AABBs are used in many of
today’s games; developers often refer to them as the model’s bounding
box. Again, the tradeoff for speed is precision. Because AABBs always
have to be axis-aligned, we can’t just rotate them when the object
rotates — they have to be recomputed for each frame. Still, this
computation isn’t difficult and doesn’t slow us down much if we know the
extents of each character model. However, we still face precision
issues. For example, let’s assume that we’re spinning a thin, rigid rod
in 3D, and we’d like to construct an AABB for each frame of the
animation. As we can see, the box approximates each frame differently
and the precision varies (Figure 6).

| **Figure 6. Successive AABBs for a spinning<span                         |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 

So, rather than use AABBs, why can’t we use boxes that are arbitrarily
oriented and minimize the empty space, or error, of the box
approximation. This technique is based on what are called oriented
bounding boxes (OBBs) and has been used for ray tracing and interference
detection for quite some time. This technique is not only more accurate,
but also more robust than the AABB technique, as we shall see. However,
OBBs are lot more difficult to implement, slower, and inappropriate for
dynamic or procedural models (an object that morphs, for instance). It’s
important to note that when we subdivide an object into more and more
pieces, or volumes, we’re actually creating a hierarchical tree of that
starting volume.

Our choice between AABBs and OBBs should be based upon the level of
accuracy that we need. For a fast-action 3D shooter, we’re probably
better off implementing AABB collision detection — we can spare a little
accuracy for the ease of implementation and speed. The source code that
accompanies this article is available from the Game Developer web site.
It should get you started with AABBs, as well as providing some examples
of source code from several collision detection packages that also
implement OBBs. Now that we have a basic idea of how everything works,
let’s look at the details of the implementation.

**Building Trees**

Creating OBB trees from an arbitrary mesh is probably the most difficult
part of the algorithm, and it has to be tweaked and adjusted to suit the
engine or game type. Figure 7 shows the creation of successive OBBs from
a starting model. As we can see, we have to find the tightest box (or
volume, in the case of 3D) around a given model (or set of vertices).

There are several ways to precompute OBBs, and they all involve a lot of
math. The basic method is to calculate the mean of the distribution of
vertices as the center of the box and then calculate the covariance
matrix. We then use two of the three eigenvectors of the covariance
matrix to align the box with the geometry. We can also use a convex hull
routine to further speed up and optimize tree creation. You can find the
complete derivation in the Gottschalk, Lin, and Manocha paper cited in
the “For Further Info” section.

Building AABB trees is much easier because we don’t have to find the
minimum bounding volume and its axis. We just have to decide where to
split the model and we get the box construction for free (because it’s a
box parallel with the coordinate axes and it contains all of the
vertices from one side of the separating plane).

So, now that we have all of the boxes, we have to construct a tree. We
could use a top-down approach whereby we begin with the starting volume
and recursively subdivide it. Alternatively, we could use a bottom-up
approach, merging smaller volumes to get the largest volume. To
subdivide the largest volume into smaller ones, we should follow several
suggested rules. We split the volume along the longest axis of the box
with a plane (a plane orthogonal to one of its axes) and then partition
the polygons based upon which side of the partitioning axis they fall
(Figure 7). If we can’t subdivide along the longest axis, we subdivide
along the second longest. We continue until we can’t split the volume
any more, and we’re left with a triangle or a planar polygon. Depending
on how much accuracy we really need (for instance, do we really need to
detect when a single triangle is collided?), we can stop subdividing
based on some arbitrary rule that we propose (the depth of a tree, the
number of triangles in a volume, and so on).

As you can see, the building phase is quite complex and involves a
considerable amount of computation. You definitely can’t build your
trees during the run time — they must be computed ahead of time.
Precomputing trees eliminates the possibility of changing geometry
during the run time. Another drawback is that OBBs require a large
amount of matrix computations. We have to position them in space, and
each subtree has to be multiplied by a matrix.

| tests that we could perform would be to project the boxes on some axis   |
| in space and check whether the intervals overlap. If they don’t, the     |
| given axis is called a separating axis (Figure 8).                       |

| To check quickly for overlap, we’ll use something called the <span       |
| style="background-color:#e53333;">Separating Axis Theorem</span>. This   |
| theorem tells us that we have only 15 potential separating axes. If      |
| overlap occurs on every single separating axis, the boxes intersect.     |
| Thus, it’s very easy to determine whether or not two boxes intersect.    |
|                                                                          |
| Interestingly, the time gradient problem mentioned earlier could easily  |
| be solved by the separating axis technique. Remember that the problem    |
| involved determining whether a collision has occurred in between any two |
| given times. If we add velocities to the box projection intervals and    |
| they overlap on all 15 axes, then a collision has occurred. We could     |
| also use an structure that resembles an AABB tree to separate colliders  |
| and collidees and check whether they have a possibility of collision.    |
| This calculation can quickly reject the majority of the cases in a scene |
| and will perform in an O(N logN) time that is close to optimal.          |

| **Collision Techniques Based on BSP Trees**                              |
|                                                                          |
| BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) trees are another type of space          |
| subdivision technique that’s been in use for many years in the game      |
| industry (*Doom*<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>was the      |
| first commercial game that used BSP trees). Even though BSP trees aren’t |
| as popular today as they have been over the past couple of years, the    |
| three most licensed game engines today —<span                            |
| class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>*Quake II, Unreal*, and Lithtech — |
| still use them quite extensively. The beauty and extreme efficiency of   |
| BSP trees comes to light when we take a look at collision detection. Not |
| only are BSP trees efficient for geometry culling, we also get very      |
| efficient world-object collision almost for free.                        |
|                                                                          |
| The BSP tree traversal is the fundamental technique used with BSPs.      |
| Collision detection basically is reduced to this tree traversal, or      |
| search. This approach is powerful because it rejects a lot of geometry   |
| early, so in the end, we only test the collision detection against a     |
| small number of planes. As we’ve seen before, finding a separating plane |
| between two objects is sufficient for determining that those two objects |
| don’t intersect. If a separating plane exists, no collision has          |
| occurred. So, we can recursively traverse a world’s tree and check       |
| whether separating planes intersect the bounding sphere or bounding box. |
| We can increase the accuracy of this approach by checking for every one  |
| of the object’s polygons. The easiest way to perform this check is to    |
| test whether all parts of the object are on the same side of the plane.  |
| This calculation is extremely simple. We can use the Cartesian plane     |
| equation, ax + by + cz + d = 0, to determine the side of the plane upon  |
| which the point lies. If the equation is satisfied, then our point lies  |
| on the plane. If ax + by + cz + d \> 0, then the point is on the         |
| positive side the plane. If ax + by + cz + d \< 0, then the point is on  |
| the negative side the plane.                                             |
|                                                                          |
| The only important thing to note is that for a collision not to occur,   |
| all of the points of an object (or a bounding box) have to be on either  |
| the positive or the negative side of a given plane. If we have points on |
| both the positive and negative side of the plane, a collision has        |
| occurred and the plane intersects the given object.                      |
|                                                                          |
| Unfortunately, we have no elegant way of checking whether a collision    |
| has occurred in between the two intervals (although the techniques       |
| discussed at the beginning of this article still apply). However, I have |
| yet to see another structure that has as many uses as a BSP tree.        |
|                                                                          |
| **Curved Objects and Collision Detection**                               |
|                                                                          |
| Now that we’ve seen two approaches to collision detection for polygonal  |
| objects, lets see how we can compute the collision of curved objects.    |
| Several games will be coming out in 1999 that use curved surfaces quite  |
| extensively, so the efficient collision detection of curved surfaces     |
| will be very important in the coming year. The collision detection       |
| (which involves exact surface evaluation at a given point) of curved     |
| surfaces is extremely computationally intensive, so we’ll try to avoid   |
| it. We’ve already discussed several methods that we could use in this    |
| case, as well. The most obvious approach is to approximate the curved    |
| surface with a lowest-tessellation representation and use this polytope  |
| for collision detection. An even easier, but less accurate, method is to |
| construct a convex hull out of the control vertices of the curved        |
| surface and use it for the collision detection. In any case, curved      |
| surface collision approximation is very similar to general polytope      |
| collision detection. Figure 9 shows the curved surface and the convex    |
| hull formed from the control vertices.                                   |
|                                                                          |

| If we combined both techniques into a sort of hybrid approach, we could  |
| first test the collision against the hull and then recursively subdivide |
| the patch to which the hull belongs, thus increasing the accuracy        |
| tremendously.                                                            |
