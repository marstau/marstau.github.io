<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">The A\*
(pronounced A-star) </span></span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">algorithm </span></span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">can be complicated for beginners. While there
are many articles on the web that explain A\*, most are written for
people who understand the basics already. This article is for the true
beginner.</span></span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"> </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">This article does not
try to be the definitive work on the subject. Instead it describes the
fundamentals and prepares you to go out and read all of those other
materials and understand what they are talking about. Links to some of
the best are provided at the end of this article, under Further
Reading.</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Finally, this article
is not program-specific. You should be able to adapt what's here to any
computer language. As you might expect, however, I have included a link
to a sample program at the end of this article. The sample package
contains two versions: one in C++ and one in Blitz Basic. It also
contains executables if you just want to see A\* in action. </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">But we are getting
ahead of ourselves. Let's start at the beginning ...</span>

**<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Introduction: The
Search Area </span>**

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Let’s assume that we
have someone who wants to get from point A to point B. Let’s assume that
a wall separates the two points. This is illustrated below, with green
being the starting point A, and red being the ending point B, and the
blue filled squares being the wall in between. </span>

style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  </span>\
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">[Figure 1]</span>

 

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">The first thing you should notice is that we
have </span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">divided our search area into a square
grid</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">. Simplifying the search
area, as we have done here, is </span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">the first step </span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">in pathfinding. This particular method reduces
our search area to a simple two dimensional array. Each item in the
array represents one of the squares on the grid, and</span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> its
status is recorded as walkable or unwalkable</span></span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">. The path is found by figuring out which
squares we should take to get from A to B. Once the path is found, our
person moves from the center of one square to the center of the next
until the target is reached. </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">These
center points are called </span></span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">“</span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">nodes</span>**<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">”.
When you read about pathfinding elsewhere, you will often see people
discussing nodes. Why not just call them squares? Because it is possible
to divide up your pathfinding area into something other than squares.
They could be rectangles, hexagons, triangles, or any shape, really. And
the nodes could be placed anywhere within the shapes – in the center or
along the edges, or anywhere else. We are using this system, however,
because it is the simplest.</span></span>

**<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Starting the Search
</span>**

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Once we have
simplified our search area into a manageable number of nodes, as we have
done with the grid layout above, the next step is to conduct a search to
find the shortest path. We do this by starting at point A, checking the
adjacent squares, and generally searching outward until we find our
target.  </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">**We begin the search
by doing the following:**</span>

1.  <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Begin at the starting point A and add it to
    an “</span></span>**<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">open list</span></span>**<span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">”
    of squares to be considered. The open list is a kind of like a
    shopping list. Right now there is just one item on the list, but we
    will have more later. It contains squares that might fall along the
    path you want to take, but maybe not. Basically, this is a list of
    squares that need to be checked out.</span></span></span>

2.  <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Look at all the reachable or walkable
    squares adjacent to the starting point, ignoring squares with walls,
    water, or other illegal terrain. Add them to the open list, too. For
    each of these squares, save point A as its “</span></span>**<span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">parent square</span></span>**<span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">”.
    This parent square stuff is important when we want to trace our
    path. It will be explained more later.</span></span></span>

3.  <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Drop the starting square A from your open
    list, and add it to a “</span></span>**<span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">closed list</span></span>**<span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">”
    of squares that you don’t need to look at again for
    now</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">. </span></span>


<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">At this point, you
should have something like the following illustration. In this
illustration, the dark green square in the center is your starting
square. It is outlined in light blue to indicate that the square has
been added to the closed list. All of the adjacent squares are now on
the open list of squares to be checked, and they are outlined in light
green. Each has a gray pointer that points back to its parent, which is
the starting square.  </span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"></span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  [Figure 2]</span>

 

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Next, we choose one of
the adjacent squares on the open list and more or less repeat the
earlier process, as described below. But which square do we choose? The
one with the lowest F cost.</span>

**<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Path
Scoring</span>**

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">The key to determining
which squares to use when figuring out the path is the following
equation:</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">F = G + H  </span>\
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Fitness = Goal + Heuristic.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">where </span>


-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">G = the </span><span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">movement cost to move from the starting
    point A to a given square on the grid</span></span><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">, following the path generated to get
    there. </span></span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">H = the estimated movement </span><span
    style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">cost to move from that given square on the
    grid to the final destination</span></span><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">, point B. This is often referred to as the
    heuristic, which can be a bit confusing. The reason why it is called
    that is because it is a guess. We really don’t know the actual
    distance until we find the path, because all sorts of things can be
    in the way (walls, water, etc.). You are given one way to calculate
    H in this tutorial, but there are many others that you can find in
    other articles on the web.</span></span>


<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Our path is generated by repeatedly going
through our open list and choosing the square with the lowest F score.
This process will be described in more detail a bit further in the
article. First l</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">et’s look more closely at
how we calculate the equation.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">As described above, G is the
movement cost to move from the starting point to the given square using
the path generated to get there. In this example, we will assign a cost
of 10 to each horizontal or vertical square moved, and a cost of 14 for
a diagonal move. We use these numbers because the actual distance to
move diagonally is the square root of 2 (don’t be scared), or roughly
1.414 times the cost of moving horizontally or vertically. We use 10 and
14 for simplicity’s sake. The ratio is about right, and we avoid having
to calculate square roots and we avoid decimals. This isn’t just because
we are dumb and don’t like math. Using whole numbers like these is a lot
faster for the computer, too. As you will soon find out, pathfinding can
be very slow if you don’t use short cuts like these.</span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Since we are
calculating the G cost along a specific path to a given square, the way
to figure out the G cost of that square is to take the G cost of its
parent, and then add 10 or 14 depending on whether it is diagonal or
orthogonal (non-diagonal) from that parent square. The need for this
method will become apparent a little further on in this example, as we
get more than one square away from the starting square.</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">H can be estimated in a variety of ways. The
method we use here is called the </span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Manhattan method</span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">, where you calculate the total number of
squares moved horizontally and vertically to reach the target square
from the current square, ignoring diagonal movement, and ignoring any
obstacles that may be in the way. We then multiply the total by 10, our
cost for moving one square horizontally or vertically. This is
(probably) called the Manhattan method because it is like calculating
the number of city blocks from one place to another, where you can’t cut
across the block diagonally. </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Reading this description, you might guess that
the heuristic is merely a rough estimate of the remaining distance
between the current square and the target "as the crow flies." This
isn't the case. We are actually trying to estimate the remaining
distance along the path (which is usually farther). </span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">The closer our estimate is to the actual
remaining distance, the faster the algorithm will be.</span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> If we overestimate this distance, however, it
is not guaranteed to give us the shortest path. In such cases, we have
what is called an "inadmissible heuristic."</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Technically, in this
example, the Manhattan method is inadmissible because it slightly
overestimates the remaining distance. But we will use it anyway because
it is </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">a lot
easier to understand for our purposes</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">, and because it is only a slight
overestimation. On the rare occasion when the resulting path is not the
shortest possible, it will be nearly as short. Want to know more? You
can find equations and additional notes on heuristics </span>[<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">here</span>](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/heuristics.htm)<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">F is calculated by
adding G and H. The results of the first step in our search can be seen
in the illustration below. The F, G, and H scores are written in each
square. As is indicated in the square to the immediate right of the
starting square, F is printed in the top left, G is printed in the
bottom left, and H is printed in the bottom right. </span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> 
</span>![](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarT3.jpg)\
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  </span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">[Figure 3]  </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">So let’s look at some
of these squares. In the square with the letters in it, G = 10. This is
because it is just one square from the starting square in a horizontal
direction. The squares immediately above, below, and to the left of the
starting square all have the same G score of 10. The diagonal squares
have G scores of 14. </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">The H scores are
calculated by estimating the Manhattan distance to the red target
square, moving only horizontally and vertically and ignoring the wall
that is in the way. Using this method, the square to the immediate right
of the start is 3 squares from the red square, for a H score of 30. The
square just above this square is 4 squares away (remember, only move
horizontally and vertically) for an H score of 40. You can probably see
how the H scores are calculated for the other squares. </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">The F score for each
square, again, is simply calculated by adding G and H together.</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Continuing the Search</span>
==============================================================================

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">To continue the search, </span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">we
simply choose the lowest F score square from all those that are on the
open list</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">. We then do the
following with the selected square: </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">4)</span><span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> </span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Drop it
from the open list and add it to the closed list.</span></span></span>
</span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">5) Check all of the adjacent squares.
Ignoring those that are on the closed list or unwalkable (terrain with
walls, water, or other illegal terrain), add squares to the open list if
they are not on the open list already. Make the selected square the
“parent” of the new squares. </span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">6) </span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">If an
adjacent square is already on the open list, check to see if this path
to that square is a better one. In other words, check to see if the G
score for that square is lower if we use the current square to get
there. </span></span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">If not, don’t do anything. </span></span>\
<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">On the other hand, if the G cost of the new path
is lower, change the parent of the adjacent square to the selected
square (in the diagram above, change the direction of the pointer to
point at the selected square). Finally, recalculate both the F and G
scores of that square. If this seems confusing, you will see it
illustrated below.</span></span> </span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Okay, so let’s see how this works. Of our
initial 9 squares, we have 8 left on the open list after the starting
square was switched to the closed list.</span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  Of these, the one with the lowest F cost is
the one to the immediate right of the starting square, with an F score
of 40. So we select this square as our next square. It is highlight in
blue in the following </span></span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">illustration</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">.</span></span> <span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> 
</span>![](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarT4.jpg)<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  </span>\
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">[Figure 4]  </span></span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: xx-small"></span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">First, we drop it from our open list and add it
to our closed list (that’s why it’s now highlighted in
blue).</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">  Then we check the adjacent
squares. Well, the ones to the immediate right of this square are wall
squares, so we ignore those. The one to the immediate left is the
starting square. That’s on the closed list, so we ignore that,
too. </span> </span></span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">The other four squares are
already on the open list, so we need to check if the paths to those
squares are any better using this square to get there, using G scores as
our point of reference. Let’s look at the square right above our
selected square. Its current G score is 14. If we instead went through
the current square to get there, the G score would be equal to 20 (10,
which is the G score to get to the current square, plus 10 more to go
vertically to the one just above it). A G score of 20 is higher than 14,
so this is not a better path. That should make sense if you look at the
diagram. It’s more direct to get to that square from the starting square
by simply moving one square diagonally to get there, rather than moving
horizontally one square, and then vertically one square. </span></span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">When we repeat this process
for all 4 of the adjacent squares already on the open list, we find that
none of the paths are improved by going through the current square, so
we don’t change anything. So now that we looked at all of the adjacent
squares, we are done with this square, and ready to move to the next
square. </span></span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">So we go through the list of squares on our open
list, which is now down to 7 squares, and we pick the one with the
lowest F cost. Interestingly, in this case, there are two squares with a
score of 54. So which do we choose? It doesn’t really matter.
</span>**<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">For the purposes of
speed,</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> it can be faster to choose
the </span>**<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">last</span>**</span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> one you added to the open list.</span>**<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> This biases the search in favor of squares that
get found later on in the search, when you have gotten closer to the
target. But it doesn’t really matter. (Differing treatment of ties is
why two versions of A\* may find different paths of equal
length.)</span></span></span>

<span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">So let’s choose the one just
below, and to the right of the starting square, as is shown in the
following </span></span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">illustration</span><span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span

</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">[Figure 5] 
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">This time, when we check the adjacent squares we
find that the one to the immediate right is a wall square, so we ignore
that. The same goes for the one just above that. We also ignore the
square just below the wall. Why?</span><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">
Because you can’t get to that square directly from the current square
without cutting across the corner of the nearby
wall.(因为要当前square走向右下角的时候碰到墙壁遮挡了一半的来路,要穿过去是不现实的.)</span></span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"> You really need to go down first and then move
over to that square, moving around the corner in the
process. (</span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Note: This rule on cutting corners is optional.
</span></span></span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Its use
depends on how your nodes are placed</span></span><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">.)</span></span>

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">That leaves five other
squares.  The other two squares below the current square aren’t already
on the open list, so we add them and the current square becomes their
parent. Of the other three squares, two are already on the closed list
(the starting square, and the one just above the current square, both
highlighted in blue in the diagram), so we ignore them. And the last
square, to the immediate left of the current square, is checked to see
if the G score is any lower if you go through the current square to get
there. No dice. So we’re done and ready to check the next square on our
open list.  </span></span>

somewhere along the way on our search, where the G score was checked and
it turned out to be lower using a new path – so the parent was switched

***<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">1.  Other Units
(collision avoidance):</span>*** <span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">If you happen to look
closely at my example code, you will notice that it completely ignores
other units on the screen. The units pass right through each other.
Depending on the game, this may be acceptable or it may not.</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"> If you want to consider
other units in the pathfinding algorithm and have them move around one
another, I suggest that you only consider units that are either stopped
or adjacent to the pathfinding unit at the time the path is calculated,
treating their current locations as unwalkable. </span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">For adjacent units that are
moving, you can discourage collisions by penalizing nodes that lie along
their respective paths, thereby encouraging the pathfinding unit to find
an alternate route (described more under \#2).</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">If you choose to
consider other units that are moving and not adjacent to the pathfinding
unit, you will need to develop a method for predicting where they will
be at any given point in time so that they can be dodged properly.
Otherwise you will probably end up with strange paths where units
zig-zag to avoid other units that aren't there anymore. </span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">You will also, of
course, need to develop some collision detection code because no matter
how good the path is at the time it is calculated, things can change
over time. When a collision occurs a unit must either calculate a new
path or, if the other unit is moving and it is not a head-on collision,
wait for the other unit to step out of the way before proceeding with
the current path.</span><span

***<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">2. Variable Terrain
Cost: </span>***<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">In
this tutorial and my accompanying program, terrain is just one of two
things – walkable or unwalkable. But what if you have terrain that is
walkable, but at a higher movement cost? Swamps, hills, stairs in a
dungeon, etc. – these are all examples of terrain that is walkable, but
at a higher cost than flat, open ground. Similarly, a road might have a
lower movement cost than the surrounding terrain.</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">This problem is easily
handled by adding the terrain cost in when you are calculating the G
cost of any given node. Simply add a bonus cost to such nodes. The A\*
pathfinding algorithm is already written to find the lowest cost path
and should handle this easily. In the simple example I described, when
terrain is only walkable or unwalkable, A\* will look for the shortest,
most direct path. But in a variable-cost terrain environment, the least
cost path might involve traveling a longer distance – like taking a road
around a swamp rather than plowing straight through it.</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">An interesting additional consideration is
something the professionals call “influence mapping.” Just as with the
variable terrain costs described above, you could create an additional
point system and apply it to paths for AI purposes. Imagine that you
have a map with a bunch of units defending a pass through a mountain
region. Every time the computer sends somebody on a path through that
pass, it gets whacked. If you wanted, you could create an influence map
that penalized nodes where lots of carnage is taking place. This would
teach the computer to favor safer paths, and help it avoid dumb
situations where it keeps sending troops through a particular path, just
because it is shorter (but also more dangerous).</span>\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Yet another possible use is penalizing nodes
that lie along the paths of nearby moving units. One of the downsides of
A\* is that when a group of units all try to find paths to a similar
location, there is usually a significant amount of overlap, as one or
more units try to take the same or similar routes to their destinations.
Adding a penalty to nodes already 'claimed' by other units will help
ensure a degree of separation, and reduce collisions. Don't treat such
nodes as unwalkable, however, because you still want multiple units to
be able to squeeze through tight passageways in single file, if
necessary. Also, you should only penalize the paths of units that are
near the pathfinding unit, not all paths, or you will get strange
dodging behavior as units avoid paths of units that are nowhere near
them at the time. Also, you should only penalize path nodes that lie
along the current and future portion of a path, not previous path nodes
that have already been visited and left behind.</span>\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">3. Handling Unexplored Areas: </span>***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Have you ever played a PC game where the
computer always knows exactly what path to take, even though the map
hasn't been explored yet? Depending upon the game, pathfinding that is
too good can be unrealistic. Fortunately, this is a problem that is can
be handled fairly easily.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">The answer is to create a
separate "knownWalkability" array for each of the various players and
computer opponents (each player, not each unit -- that would require a
lot more computer memory). Each array would contain information about
the areas that the player has explored, with the rest of the map assumed
to be walkable until proven otherwise. Using this approach, units will
wander down dead ends and make similar wrong choices until they have
learned their way around. Once the map is explored, however, pathfinding
would work normally.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">4. Smoother Paths: </span>***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">While A\* will automatically give you the
shortest, lowest cost path, it won't automatically give you the
smoothest looking path. Take a look at the final path calculated in our
example (in Figure 7). On that path, the very first step is below, and
to the right of the starting square. Wouldn't our path be smoother if
the first step was instead the square directly below the starting
square?</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">There are several ways to address this problem.
While you are calculating the path you could penalize nodes where there
is a change of direction, adding a penalty to their G scores.
Alternatively, you could run through your path after it is calculated,
looking for places where choosing an adjacent node would give you a path
that looks better. For more on the whole issue, check out </span>[<span

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">5. Non-square Search Areas: </span>***<span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">In our example, we used a
simple 2D square layout. You don't need to use this approach. You could
use irregularly shaped areas. Think of the board game Risk, and the
countries in that game. You could devise a pathfinding scenario for a
game like that. To do this, you would need to create a table for storing
which countries are adjacent to which, and a G cost associated with
moving from one country to the next. You would also need to come up with
a method for estimating H. Everything else would be handled the same as
in the above example. Instead of using adjacent squares, you would
simply look up the adjacent countries in the table when adding new items
to your open list.</span></span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Similarly, you could create
a waypoint system for paths on a fixed terrain map. Waypoints are
commonly traversed points on a path, perhaps on a road or key tunnel in
a dungeon. As the game designer, you could pre-assign these waypoints.
Two waypoints would be considered "adjacent" to one another if there
were no obstacles on the direct line path between them. As in the Risk
example, you would save this adjacency information in a lookup table of
some kind and use it when generating your new open list items. You would
then record the associated G costs (perhaps by using the direct line
distance between the nodes) and H costs (perhaps using a direct line
distance from the node to the goal). Everything else would proceed as
usual.</span></span>

</span>***</span><span
style="FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">As you develop your own A\*
program, or adapt the one I wrote, you will eventually find that
pathfinding is using a hefty chunk of your CPU time, particularly if you
have a decent number of pathfinding units on the board and a reasonably
large map. If you read the stuff on the net, you will find that this is
true even for the professionals who design games like Starcraft or Age
of Empires. If you see things start to slow down due to pathfinding,
here are some ideas that may speed things up: </span></span>

-   \

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Consider a smaller
    map or fewer units.</span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Never do path
    finding for more than a few units at a time. Instead put them in a
    queue and spread them out over several game cycles. If your game is
    running at, say, 40 cycles per second, no one will ever notice. But
    they will notice if the game seems to slow down every once in a
    while when a bunch of units are all calculating paths at the same
    time.</span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Consider using larger squares (or whatever
    shape you are using) for your map. This reduces the total number of
    nodes searched to find the path. If you are ambitious, you can
    devise two or more pathfinding systems that are used in different
    situations, depending upon the length of the path. This is what the
    professionals do, using large areas for long paths, and then
    switching to finer searches using smaller squares/areas when you get
    close to the target. If you are interested in this concept, check
    out my article </span>[<span style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Two-Tiered A\*
    Pathfinding</span>](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/twoTiered.htm)<span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">.</span></span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">For longer paths,
    consider devising precalculated paths that are hardwired into the
    game.</span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">Consider
    pre-processing your map to figure out what areas are inaccessible
    from the rest of the map. I call these areas "islands." In reality,
    they can be islands or any other area that is otherwise walled off
    and inaccessible. One of the downsides of A\* is that if you tell it
    to look for paths to such areas, it will search the whole map,
    stopping only when every accessible square/node has been processed
    through the open and closed lists. That can waste a lot of CPU time.
    It can be prevented by predetermining which areas are inaccessible
    (via a flood-fill or similar routine), recording that information in
    an array of some kind, and then checking it before beginning a path
    search.</span>

-   <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">In a crowded,
    maze-like environment, consider tagging nodes that don't lead
    anywhere as dead ends. Such areas can be manually pre-designated in
    your map editor or, if you are ambitious, you could develop an
    algorithm to identify such areas automatically. Any collection of
    nodes in a given dead end area could be given a unique identifying
    number. Then you could safely ignore all dead ends when pathfinding,
    pausing only to consider nodes in a dead end area if the starting
    location or destination happen to be in the particular dead end area
    in question.</span>

is actually one of the most time consuming elements of the A\*
pathfinding algorithm. Every time you access the open list, you need to
find the square that has the lowest F cost. There are several ways you
could do this. You could save the path items as needed, and simply go
through the whole list each time you need to find the lowest F cost
square. This is simple, but really slow for long paths. This can be
improved by maintaining a sorted list and simply grabbing the first item
off the list every time you need the lowest F-cost square. When I wrote
my program, this was the first method I used.</span></span><span

in most situations, and geometrically faster (10+ times as fast) on
longer paths. If you are motivated to find out more about binary heaps,

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Another possible bottleneck is the way you clear
and maintain your data structures between pathfinding calls. I
personally prefer to store everything in arrays. While nodes can be
generated, recorded and maintained in a dynamic, object-oriented manner,
I find that the amount of time needed to create and delete such objects
adds an extra, unnecessary level of overhead that slows things down. If
you use arrays, however, you will need to clean things up between calls.
The last thing you will want to do in such cases is spend time zero-ing
everything out after a pathfinding call, especially if you have a large
map. </span>\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">I avoid this overhead
by creating a 2d array called whichList(x,y) that designates each node
on my map as either on the open list or closed list. After pathfinding
attempts, I do not zero out this array. Instead I reset the values of
onClosedList and onOpenList in every pathfinding call, incrementing both
by +5 or something similar on each path finding attempt. This way, the
algorithm can safely ignore as garbage any data left over from previous
pathfinding attempts.</span><span
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px"> I also store values like F,
G and H costs in arrays. In this case, I simply write over any
pre-existing values and don't bother clearing the arrays when I'm
done.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">Storing data in multiple arrays consumes more
memory, though, so there is a trade off. Ultimately, you should use
whatever method you are most comfortable with.</span>***\

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: x-small">***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">8. Dijkstra's Algorithm: </span>***<span
style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">While A\* is generally considered to be the best
pathfinding algorithm (see rant above), there is at least one other
algorithm that has its uses - Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's is
essentially the same as A\*, except there is no heuristic (H is always
0). Because it has no heuristic, it searches by expanding out equally in
every direction. As you might imagine, because of this Dijkstra's
usually ends up exploring a much larger area before the target is found.
This generally makes it slower than A\*. </span>\
</span>

<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 14px">So why use it?
Sometimes we don't know where our target destination is. Say you have a
resource-gathering unit that needs to go get some resources of some
kind. It may know where several resource areas are, but it wants to go
to the closest one. Here, Dijkstra's is better than A\* because we don't
know which one is closest. Our only alternative is to repeatedly use A\*
to find the distance to each one, and then choose that path. There are
probably countless similar situations where we know the kind of location
we might be searching for, want to find the closest one, but not know
where it is or which one might be closest.</span>

you have the basics and a sense of some of the advanced concepts. At
this point, I’d suggest wading into my source code. The package contains
two versions, one in C++ and one in Blitz Basic. Both versions are
heavily commented and should be fairly easy to follow, relatively
speaking.  Here is the link.</span></span>
