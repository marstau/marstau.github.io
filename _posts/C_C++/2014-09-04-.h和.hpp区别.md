From:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152555/h-or-hpp-for-your-class-definitions
I use .hpp because I want the user to differenciate what headers are C++ headers, and what headers are C headers.

This can be important when your project is using both C and C++ modules: Like someone else explained before me, you should do it very carefully, and its starts by the "contract" you offer through the extension

.hpp : C++ Headers
(Or .hxx, or .hh, or whatever)

This header is for C++ only.

If you're in a C module, don't even try to include it. You won't like it, because no effort is done to make it C-friendly (too much would be lost, like function overloading, namespaces, etc. etc.).

.h : C/C++ compatible or pure C Headers
This header can be included by both a C source, and a C++ source, directly or indirectly.

It can included directly, being protected by the __cplusplus macro:

Which mean that, from a C++ viewpoint, the C-compatible code will be defined as extern "c".
From a C viewpoint, all the C code will be plainly visible, but the C++ code will be hidden (because it won't compile in a C compiler).
For example:

#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

   #ifdef __cpluplus
      extern "C"
      {
   #endif

   void myCFunction() ;

   #ifdef __cpluplus
      } // extern "C"
   #endif

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
Or it could be included indirectly by the corresponding .hpp header enclosing it with the extern "c" declaration.

For example:

#ifndef MY_HEADER_HPP
#define MY_HEADER_HPP

extern "C"
{
#include "my_header.h"
}

#endif // MY_HEADER_HPP
and:

#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

void myCFunction() ;

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
